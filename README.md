# Deep_Learning_TensorFlow
<h1> TensorFlow - Deep learning approach </h1>
In this repository, I would like to upload some of my research projects of deep learning with TensorFlow and Python. I will separate into
sections, hope that they can help people who are new to deep learning can understand and have passion of this domain. <br>
<h3> SECTIONS: </h3>
<i>- Section 01:</i> Equations and matrices<br>
<i>- Section 02:</i> Hand-writing patterns recognition<br>
<i>- Section 03:</i> Training and Convergence<br>
